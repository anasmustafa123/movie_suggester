# [MtvInsight]()  

## Description
MtvInsight is a movie and TV shows prediction website that leverages a dataset comprising 10k movies and 11k TV shows manually collected from [The Movie Database](https://developer.themoviedb.org/docs/getting-started). The prediction process involves converting each movie or TV show into a vector and determining their similarity based on the direction of these vectors. A small angle between vectors indicates similarity in content.
